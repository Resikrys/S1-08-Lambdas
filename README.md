# SPRINT 1
## TASK 8: Lambdas

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
Given a list of Strings, write a method that returns a 
list of all strings that contain the letter ‚Äòo‚Äô. Print 
the result.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 2
You have to do the same as in the previous point, but now, 
the method must return a list with the Strings that in 
addition to containing the letter ‚Äòo‚Äô also have more than 
5 letters. Print the result.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
Create a list with the names of the months of the year. 
Print all the elements of the list with a lambda.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 4
Make the same print as the previous point, but using 
method reference.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 5
Create a Functional Interface with a method called 
getPiValue() that must return a double. From the main() 
of the main class, instantiate the interface and assign 
it the value 3.1415. Call the getPiValue() method and print 
the result.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 6
Create a list with numbers and text strings and sort 
the list with the strings from shortest to longest.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 7
With the list from the previous exercise, now sort it in 
reverse, from the longest chain to shortest.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 8
Create a Functional Interface that contains a method 
called reverse(). This method must receive and return a 
String. In the main() of the main class, inject the body 
of the method into the interface created using a lambda, 
so that it returns the same string that it receives as a 
parameter but in reverse. Invoke the interface instance 
by passing it a string and check if the result is correct.

### LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 1
Create a list of strings with proper names. Write a method that returns 
a list of all strings that start with the letter 'A' (uppercase) and 
have exactly 3 letters. Print the result.

### LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 2
Program a method that returns a comma-separated string, based on a list 
of Integers. Each element must be preceded by the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù if the 
number is even, or by the letter ‚Äúo‚Äù if the number is odd. For example, 
if the input list is (3, 55, 44), the output must be ‚Äúo3, o55, e44‚Äù. 
Print the result.

### LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 3
Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called operation(). 
This method must return a float. Inject the body of the method into the 
interface created using a lambda, so that the operation can be 
transformed with an addition, a subtraction, a multiplication and 
a division.

### LEVEL 2 - EXERCISE 4
Create a list containing some text strings and numbers.

Sort them by:
- Alphabetically by the first character. (Note: charAt(0) returns the 
numeric code of the first character)
- Strings containing an "e" first, all other strings after. Put the code 
directly in the lambda.
- Modify all elements in the list that have an 'a'. Modify the 'a' to 
a '4'.
- Only display elements that are numeric. (Even if they are stored as 
Strings).

- Step 2: Compile & Run the program

```bash
cd C:\Users\elyri\IdeaProjects\S1_08_Lambdas   # Go to root file directory
javac -d out src\s1_08_alambdas\*.java   # -d out indicates that the compiled .classes will be placed in an out folder
java -cp out s1_08_alambdas.Task8  # -cp out tells Java where to look for the .class
